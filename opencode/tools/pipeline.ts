/**
 * Custom tool that runs an ai-coding pipeline from within OpenCode.
 *
 * The LLM can call this tool when it determines that a pipeline is the right
 * action -- for example, when asked to scaffold a new project or run a dev
 * cycle on a workspace.
 *
 * The monorepo root is resolved from the AI_CODING_MONOREPO environment
 * variable, which is set globally by Home Manager. This allows the tool to
 * work from any project directory.
 *
 * The tool shells out to `bun run pipeline` in the monorepo root and returns
 * the full pipeline output for the LLM to summarise.
 *
 * Bun is resolved by probing known Nix and system locations so the tool
 * works even when OpenCode does not inherit the full login PATH.
